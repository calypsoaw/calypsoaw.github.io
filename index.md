### CPSC 120

* Lab 3
  
  Lab 3 part 2 was a favorite because of the partner that I had at the time of this lab. He explained to me thoroughly how to attack the problem, and it allowed me to appropriately retain the information that I needed to excel through the course. Looking back, this lab was very simple, but walking me through how to initialize Julian_Day function and printing the words on the screen using the std::cout call set the foundation for my coding skills increasing for the remainder of the semester.

  Lab 5 
  
  Lab 5 part 2 was a favorite because it was a challenge for me. I spent about an hour and a half looking for the error that I was given via the “make test” command in my terminal. The error turned out to be a comma! This lab showed me how much you really have to pay attention to detail while coding, and I don’t think that I’ve ever had an error that was “hidden in plain sight” since. 

  Lab 6

  Lab 6 Part 1 was a favorite because it was reviewed in a previous lab. I already knew what I was doing within the sandwich.cc file, because I had experience from the previous lab, so I was able to successfully complete it. This was also a favorite because I was able to explain, in depth, to my partner what I was doing, while actually knowing what I was doing. Part 2 was very challenging, so Lab 6 was a good balance of challenging and easy.
